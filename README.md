* Instructions on how to use this codeï¼šðŸ’­
1. We can see the far left side of the code, configuring the initial settings for Neopixel and OLED in the start module.(Using Pin 0 to Control Neopixel Ring LEDs)ðŸ‘‡

2. The below code module is the text that turns on the OLED by pressing button A, displays the N-shaped logo and starts by pressing the button.ðŸ‘‰

3. Then next to the right, cycle through the Forever module to read the data on pin 2 (pin 2 is connected to the pulse sensor for heart rate measurement). ðŸ‘‡

4. This is followed by pressing button B to clear the screen before displaying icons and heart rate on the OLED, as well as step-by-step text for the inhale, hold, and exhale phases. Finally, the display is switched off 10s after the end of the process.ðŸ‘‰

5. After pressing the B key, the code module here will switch on the Neopixel Ring LEDs, synchronising with the previous screen display. Set the light intensity to 50. In sequence, the red lights come on one by one for 4 seconds, the yellow lights stay on for 7 seconds, and the blue lights go off one by one for 8 seconds.ðŸ‘‡

6. Then the following code module is to switch off the display after 5 minutes (to avoid automatic switching off if the user has made a mistake or if the display has not been used for a long time).ðŸ‘‡

7. Next, the following code module is to draw 3 rectangles for landscaping the screen. It is displayed every 500ms. (New idea: phases of steps can be represented in a certain chronological order)ðŸ‘‰

8. Then the code in the forever module on the right uses a pulse sensor to measure and calculate how many beats per minute the heart rate is. And displaying a heart icon the first time finger data is detected.ðŸ‘‡

(The principle is to set the counter to 1 when a level signal greater than 870 is detected and the counter is 0. When a level signal less than 430 is detected and the counter is 1, the counter is set to 0. Determine the time taken for the level signal to reach 870 again according to the time when the counter changes, and thus calculate the time for a complete wave. Originally only 60000ms/T was needed to calculate the heart rate. However, to display the result as an integer, we use the equation (60000 - 60000 % T) / T. It should also be possible to use the rounding function in the Math code module.)


9. The last code module is used to display the heart rate value every 500 milliseconds so that the heart rate value changes on the OLED.ðŸ’›

(one problem encountered was that when the heart rate value appeared to be a three-digit number, the OLED display would stay at a three-digit display. I'm guessing this is because the numbers show up residually on the OLEDs. In order not to have incorrectly large values, I limited the value to 99. The final value could then be displayed in the normal range)
